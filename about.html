    <h1>About The Writer</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Gia. I'm the voice behind the words you are reading and I'm so glad to have you here. I've been formally writing poetry for a little bit over a year now and started this self project by launching "Words and Not". "Words and Not" is essentially my online diary for all things poetry and doodles. I have used it to connect with other creatives, gain inspiration from the community, as well as share my own pieces. My passion for poetry started years ago, when my sister would share the poems she wrote with me and I would be transcended into an emotional landscape - sometimes joyful, other times jarring. I found inspiration from her ability to describe the rawest of thoughts and still make it appear beautiful. Poetry has been an outlet that invites me to analyze everything; Whether is be a place, a subject, a person, a feeling, or a desire. Every experience has a voice through poetry and that is what makes it so special to me.

     <p>More about me: I am currently a student at Humber College, studying Computer Programming and Analysis. Where I am aiming to mix my interests of coding and writing, in order to accomplish my goal of creating an app for the writing community. I am 21 years old, I ritually apply sunscreen every morning - even in December when the sun is no where to be found. I am a sucker for tacos, a good burger, and sushi - and yes, I am aware that is basic. I live with my father and sister in Mississauga, along with our two cats. I am a coffee addict and probably consume too much for my own good, but I feel like a lot of us do. I'll keep it that, and I thank you for reading along. It was great chatting with you and I look foward to having you back on my website again.  </p>
