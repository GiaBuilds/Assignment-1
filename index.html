    <h1>Gia's Writing Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my writing portfolio, below you will find some lines showcasing some of my self written pieces. For my full portfolio, you can click the link below in order to view a year's worth of creativity and storytelling through poetry. Every piece captures a different story line, memory, or emotion in an attempt to share and inspire creativity.</p>
    <p>Poetry is intended to be read with an open mind, as interpretation is encouraged. Writing is personal, so although a certain line might mean something specific to me, it might mean something different to you. The beauty of words lies within that very concept - make it your own.</p>

    <h2>Lines From Pieces</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>"No more muttering currents and infinite lifelines. No more speaking to the wind, no more of her listening."</li>
        <li>"Write it once, then ten times over. Is this what consumption is?"</li>
        <li>"Sticky fingers and slide burns, shouting matching in good nature, catch me if you can."</li>
        <li>"Maybe we get taller, live alone, and begin over everyday. Setting the fire alarm off routinely, booking appointments, and crossing the street without a hand to hold."</li>
        <li>"Summer nights fade, glimpses of what some love most. Your ice cream's harder for longer, that's true."</li>
        <li>"Living in a penny pincher fashion for a thing that costs nothing, where  is the sense?"</li>
        <li>"If you ask I can pull my lids shut, but you need to alert me when i'm being observed too.  Provided I am, hinder it. Lets be courteous with each other fish."</li>
        <li>"Watching the thin smoke dance, ballet flats and all. Twrirling on tippy toes to some YouTube orchestra clip."</li>
        <li>"And i'll listen to that song on repeat, while I fall into my wonderland. Searching through my tweedle dees and tweedle dums."</li>
        <li>"My back burns as the sun shines through me, tropical warmth, the crust heats."</li>
    </ol>
